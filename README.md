## Overview of Project

Created an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Data Set and completed an end-to-end analysis. Technologies used: HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript Library Plotly, D3.js.

## Summary

What species are present in your navel?
What is the relative abundance of your common species?
Do some species dominate more than others?
Who are these species?

## Analysis and Challenges

- 153 participants are represented in this data set
- display the top ten most commonly found bacteria in a person's belly button
- Each of her volunteers carries a variety of bacterial species in his or her belly button.
- There is also information on the number of bacteria found for each species. The dashboard Roza has in mind will display the most common bacterial species, by count, in the navel.
- If Improbable Beef is looking for people who carry a large number of a certain bacterial species, Roza's volunteers should be able to quickly use the dashboard to figure out whether they are eligible to sell their bacteria to the company.
- The metadata array contains objects, each of which contains details of a volunteer, such as age, location, ethnicity, ID number, and weekly washing frequency of the belly button.
- we can see that names is simply an array of the ID numbers of the volunteers.
- samples array:
  - The id key identifies the ID number.
  - The otu_ids property is an array of the ID numbers of all the bacteria found in this person's navel. OTU stands for Operational Taxonomic Unit, and here it means species or bacterial type. In this instance, there were 80 bacterial types with distinct ID numbers.
  - The sample_values array contains the corresponding species name for each bacterial ID number. Some bacterial species have different ID numbers, but are clumped together under the same otu_label.

### Charts

Created a Bar Chart to display the top 10 samples.

- Used sample_values as the values for the PIE chart
- Used otu_ids as the labels for the pie chart
- Used otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart

Created a Gauge Chart to plot the Weekly Washing Frequency.

https://plotly.com/javascript/gauge-charts/

- You will need to modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 - 9.
- Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected

Created a Bubble Chart to display each sample.

https://plotly.com/javascript/bubble-charts/

- Used otu_ids for the x values
- Used sample_values for the y values
- Used sample_values for the marker size
- Used otu_ids for the marker colors
- Used otu_labels for the text values

### Theme Colors

- #2454a4
- #7153ac
- #a94da7
- #d74896
- #f84d7b
- #ff635c
- #ff8339

## Todo Checklist

A helpful checklist to gauge how your README is coming on what I would like to finish:

- [ ] Finish the theme-switch script.
- [ ] Finish the dark mode and theme.
- [ ] Finish the word-frequency script.
